Purpose:
  So this project was created using Tkinter and OpenCv2, the purpose was to apply the different coding
  libaries combine into one application. 
  The menu gives you the ability to login with a username and password *can change in code*, then enter
  into another tk.Tk() window that shows two options, one for taking notes using Tkinter 
  The other to play videos using OpenCv2 libraries

What I learned: 
  I've learned how to create a user interface with tkinter the proper way to gather user input using 
  Tkinter's libraries, along with applying pictures and buttons. 
  Followed by OpenCV2's video modules and functions that allow selecting a video file and playing possible.
  Not only that, but problem solving on different stages which one of those stages was when I wanted to integrate opening an the (the Windows File Explorer),
  with playing a video into the same function which used OpenCv2 and tkinter's libraries equiring me to combine them along with using a global variable.
